                        The South Forsyth High Science Olympiad Team has remained in competition since 2011. From 18th at Regionals to 4th at
                        State, these past few years have seen massive growth for the club and its members. South Forsyth has cemented itself as
                        a Top 5 Georgia team, and remains a serious contender for National bids this upcoming season. Their motto, <i>morior
                        invictus</i>, "death before defeat", burns in the heart of every team member. Through their shared passion for science,
                        competition, and pineapple pizza, veterans have become akin to family. Rain or shine, meetings are held every Wednesday
                        in "The Aerie", their affectionate term for home base. Members test builds, take practice tests, and attend various
                        event workshops. Students are expected to contribute time both in-school and at-home into improving at their respective
                        events. The team generally participates in 6 to 7 invitationals every season, ending with Regionals, State, and the
                        National Tournament. And yet, year after year, South has been denied a National bid, forced to end their competition
                        season on a loss. They face tough competition, teams that have been nationally-ranked for decades. But the
                        members of South Forsyth struggle to take "No" for an answer. As the 2023 season ramps up, rumors of a "new era" have
                        begun circulating on campus. The War Eagles are hungry for redemption, and they wish to prove themselves on the national
                        stage.

                            <p>
                                Team selection is based on a short application, performance
                                at tryouts, and, for veteran members only, past performance.

                            <p>
                            Out of the 100-150 of the people that typically try out, we select roughly 60-70 people to be on the team. However, this
                            may vary depending on how many people try out.

                            The membership fee is $75 which includes expenses ranging from t-shirts to registration costs for competitions. You do
                            NOT have to pay anything to try out! This one-time due covers everything from competitions to the
                            team shirt.

                            <p>
                            We typically attend 6-8 invitationals throughout the year, including regionals and state. Whether or not a team member
                            is able to compete, however, is determined by a variety of factors including meeting attendance, performance at previous
                            competitions, and commitment.

                            Competitions are held on Saturdays at colleges like Georgia Tech and other high schools (transportation is provided), as

                        In order to join the team, you must pass tryouts in mid-September. It is also highly recommended
                        that you attend the kickoff meeting. Specific dates may vary from year to year, see below.
                        <br>
                        Those who are selected through tryouts must fill out the membership form and pay a one-time due
                        of $75 (see Q&A). In order to remain in good standing to attend competitions, members must also
                        attend 75% of all meetings each semester and show commitment to preparation at meetings.
